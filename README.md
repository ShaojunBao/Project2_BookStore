# Next Steps

- Future enhancement one: I'm thinking of improve my homepage's performance. Add featured books to the homepage, but now I haven't figure out how to do that.
- Future enhancement two: Add administrator to the app, so only the administrator can add book. However, if I do so I have to use another APAI instead of the one provided by our lovely instructors. I'm also not familiar with calling API to the app, so I will try to impelement that in the future.
- Future enhancement two: The current vizualization is not good enough. I want to display 4 books each row, but I think I need to use loop to create a new "bookshelf-row" div for every four books. However, I'm really bad at building ejs. I haven't figure out how to do that.
